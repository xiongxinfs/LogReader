1. To run the codes in command line:
-java com.interview.EventLoggerApp

2. EventLoader object implements the core functions as stated in the task.
It  firstly reads the json file line by line. For each line, EventParser object is called to
map a json object to an Event object.

3.A HashMap(id, event) is used to store the Events in the memory before storing in database.
After an Event is obtained, we will check :
i) If the Event is not existed,  the event is added in the HashMap.
ii) If the Event is already existed , the duration will be calculated. If the duration is longer than 4ms, the alert
field in the Event object will be set to true.

4. EventWriter object is used to insert the Event entry to database. After that, the Event entry will be removed
from the HashMap.

5. HsqlDBWriter is dealing with the HSQLDB database connections , initialization and update.
